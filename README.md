## Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) – C Programs
This repository is a collection of C-based implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms, created as part of my DSA coursework. Each program focuses on solving a specific problem or demonstrating an algorithmic concept.
## Project Organization
The repository is divided into multiple folders named in the format prog_<number>.
Each folder represents one independent DSA program and correspoinding documentation.
Inside each prog_<number> directory, you will find the C source file related to that particular assignment with its documentation.

## OverView of the Programs
- Covers core DSA concepts and algorithms

- Programs are written using the C programming language

- Code is structured and formatted for better readability

- Intended strictly for academic practice and understanding

## Technology Used

- Programming Language : C

## Executing the Programs

Follow the steps below to run any program from the repository.

**Step 1: Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AnubhavBasnet045/dsa_assignment.git
```

***Step 2: Open a Program Directory**
```bash
cd dsa_assignment/prog_<number>
```

**Step 3: Compile the Source Code**
```bash
gcc prog_<number>.c -o program
```

**Step 4: Run the Executable**
```bash
./program
```

## Academic Objective

The purpose of this repository is to:

- Strengthen understanding of data structures and algorithms

- Practice problem-solving using C

- Maintain a structured archive of DSA assignments

- Use as a reference for revision and learning
